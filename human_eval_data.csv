Digisign Application Patching: Since Digisign’s products are delivered over the internet as SaaS software, patching is maintained by Digisign. No action is required by the customer in order to benefit from updates to the software. Application patching will follow Digisign’s Secure Software Development Lifecycle (see appendix). Digisign’s SSDLC can be found here: https://trust.Digisign.co/d/secure-software-development-lifecycle-ssdlc/GfOBOV. Digisign’s patch management pipeline does not require downtime for maintenance.
Digisign Systems patching: Digisign’s production systems check for patches every 5 minutes. If there are updates, the patches will be applied at that time. We have “tiers” of patch environments so that patches are validated in development and testing environments, then in preprod, and then in production. Once a patch has been validated, it moves to the next environment and applied to machines in that environment. A typical system patch will take 2-3 weeks to make it through the testing process to production
Critical or high risk Patches: If there are critical (or other high risk) patches, we have a separate process to speed those items along to ensure that they are applied ASAP instead of following our standard automated patching process.","Digisign SOC 2 Type II report

Digisign Application Patching: Since Digisign’s products are delivered over the internet as SaaS software, patching is maintained by Digisign. No action is required by the customer in order to benefit from updates to the software. Application patching will follow Digisign’s Secure Software Development Lifecycle (see appendix). Digisign’s SSDLC can be found here: https://trust.Digisign.co/d/secure-software-development-lifecycle-ssdlc/GfOBOV. Digisign’s patch management pipeline does not require downtime for maintenance.
Digisign Systems patching: Digisign’s production systems check for patches every 5 minutes. If there are updates, the patches will be applied at that time. We have “tiers” of patch environments so that patches are validated in development and testing environments, then in preprod, and then in production. Once a patch has been validated, it moves to the next environment and applied to machines in that environment. A typical system patch will take 2-3 weeks to make it through the testing process to production
Critical or high risk Patches: If there are critical (or other high risk) patches, we have a separate process to speed those items along to ensure that they are applied ASAP instead of following our standard automated patching process.","Are all production machines kept up-to-date with the latest security patches?

Seedling_49,Seedling,How do you determine the criticality of identified vulnerabilities?,"Criticality is determined by assessing the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive data or critical systems, and the likelihood of exploitation. Vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited remotely and lead to system compromise without user interaction are rated as critical. Impact and likelihood are both factored into the risk rating..",,perfect,2,"Digisign Penetration Test Executive Summary
-----
The risk analysis categorizes vulnerability risks based on the assessed level of severity or impact and likelihood. Impact is determined by the potential damage to information systems, business operations, reputation, etc., if the vulnerability is exploited. Likelihood is determined by the possibility or likeliness of the vulnerability being discovered and successfully exploited.","Digisign Security Incident Response Plan
-----
Critical: This rating is given to security incidents, vulnerabilities or crisis events that dramatically compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of customer confidential information or sensitive Digisign or employee data or which compromise the integrity or availability of, or allow unauthorized access to, critical Digisign systems.
